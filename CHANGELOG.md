## 2.0.0 (230830)

In version 2, the minimum PISE version is `0.28.0`, and the default is
`latest`. The build command is updated to work with PISE versions `0.28.0` and
later.

A `clean` option is added. (Potentially useful for repeated builds within a
single job.)

The input type for `container-persist` is changed to `boolean`.

## 1.1.0 (230830)

Set default PISE version to `0.27.0`, and add documentation stating that
`0.27.x` is latest compatible for `v1` of this action.

## 1.0.0 (221217)

First version!
